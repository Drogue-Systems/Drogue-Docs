### 1.0 Overview

<div><br></div>

Many different CAN standards will require different connector types be be complaint, or may offer a small list of allowed connector types. 

As a development board, the CAN-BPWRD can be used to develop with many different CAN standards and protocols. As such, the CAN bus pins were selected to enable the use of different connector types: The CAN bus pins are made from a 4 wide row of 2.54 mm pitch header pins, to which various cables can be made for and attached to.

Some common converter cables can be bought from Drogue Systems, or can be made at home to suit specific needs.
