## How to use these docs


### 1. Top Navigation Bar

At the top of the page you will find the top navigation bar. The top bar contains:

- Nav toggle: Use this to hide the navigation side bar.
- Main Website Link: This will take you to <a alt='drogue.co.uk' href='drogue.co.uk'> drogue.co.uk </a>
- Github Link: This will take you to the Drogue Systems Github home page where all of the Drogue public reposetories can be found.


### 2. Side Navigation Bar

On the left of each page in the docs you will find the navigation side bar. The side bar content will change depending on which page of the docs you are currently on to show relevant options, however the 'Home' tab will alway be present to easily return to this page.


### 3. Notes
